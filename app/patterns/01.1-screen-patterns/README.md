NOTE for improvement:
1. Add youtube, FB, Spotify, Twitter, Common Portfolio Split screen here
2. Learn to add custom properties in global.css of tailwindcss, this is for CSS that are not in the tailwind Core.
    i.e.: 
        .flex-2 {
            flex-grow: 2;
        }

        .flex-3 {
            flex-grow: 3;
        }
